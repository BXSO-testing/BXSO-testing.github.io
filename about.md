## Roster creator
As a long-time member of Science Olympiad, I've witnessed the various struggles that shuffling around dozens of people within a Google Sheet can do. Therefore, my mission with this section of the site was to:

1. Create a visual model that integrates a time schedule (blocks) with events and people
2. Make an intuitive sorting mechanism to create team compositions
3. Be able to convert the sorting results into a CSV for ease of sharing
